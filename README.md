# Constella
We scraped and used publicly available data to analyze the difference between Constellaâ€™s privately collect data and our own. In this project we highlighted the biggest differences that we saw in terms of usefulness and completeness. Our project untimely revealed that there is very little publicly available data on the topic as mandatory reporting varies by US state. While out analysis was thorough it showed that little analysis and insight can be gained from existing public data.
